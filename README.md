# Hoos Exercising
Welcome to <b>Hoos Exercising</b>, Team A-18's Spring 2021 CS3240 Web Application! The goal of Hoos Exercising is to make it easier for users in the UVA community to reach their fitness goals and track their exercise alongside other users. 
The live web application can be found at https://cs3240-a-18.herokuapp.com/

## Key Features
Below is an outline of some of our key features for the website:

- <b>Exercise Dashboard</b>: Users can input their exercises to maintain a running log of workouts through our exercise dashboard. Exercise information would include the type of exercise, the name of the exercise, and the body parts worked out. Users can also add optional notes to their workouts, to provide any additional thoughts or reflections on how the exercises were.
- <b>Leaderboard</b>: Each exercise adds 5 points to a user's total score, so we encourage users to input as many exercises as they can and reach the top! Users can also modify how the leaderboard is displayed, either by ordering by names alphabetically or by point totals.
- <b>Music</b>: Interested in finding workout music? Our "Music" tab offers users direct access to Spotify through the Spotify API. Users can find Spotify's "Today's Top Hits" playlist, or use our "Refresh" button to find a new selection of songs from that playlist. Selecting the songs directly links to the Spotify platform, and allows users to view the songs through its web platform.
- <b>Friends</b>: Any friends that were added through the Leaderboard page show up here!
- <b>Profile</b>: Users can update their profile page, including personal information, a short bio, and other details, through this tab on our website!
